    "Syriatel, a telecommunications company, is experiencing a significant rate of customer churn. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, is a critical issue in the telecom industry. Retaining customers is not only more cost-effective than acquiring new ones but also crucial for sustaining profitability and market position. This project aims to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling Syriatel to implement proactive retention strategies to mitigate revenue loss.\n",
